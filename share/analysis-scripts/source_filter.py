"""This file provides some functions to open and filter source files
before they are used by other scripts. These filters help improve
the efficiency of regex-based heuristics."""

# These filters require external tools, either in the PATH, or in
# environment variables (the latter has higher priority than the former).
# - scc (a fork including option -k), to remove C comments (variable SCC);
# - astyle, to re-indent lines (variable ASTYLE)
# If a tool is absent, the filter is equivalent to a no-op.

# These functions receive a file object (such as produced by open(),
# subprocess.run, or a previous filter) and return a
# file object containing the output. They abort execution in case
# of errors when running the filters. Note that an absent tool
# does _not_ lead to an error.
