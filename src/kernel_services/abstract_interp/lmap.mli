  val default_contents: v default_contents
  (** This function is used to optimize functions that add keys in a map,
      in particular when maintaining canonicity w.r.t. default contents.
      It describes the contents [c] of the offsetmap
      resulting from [default_offsetmap b]. The possible values are:
      - [Bottom] means that [c] is [V.bottom] everywhere, and furthermore
        that [V.bottom] has an empty concretization. We deduce from this
        fact that unmapped keys do not contribute to a join, and that
        [join c v] is never [c] as soon as [v] is not itself [v].
      - [Top] means that [c] is [V.top] everywhere. Thus unmapped keys
        have a default value more general than the one in a map where the
        key is bound.
      - [`Constant v] means that [c] is an offsetmap with a single interval
        containing [v] everywhere. [v] must be isotropic (in the sense
        of {!V.is_isotropic}).
      - [`Other] means that [default_offsetmap] returns something arbitrary.

      This function is only used on keys that change values. Thus it is
      safe to have [default_offsetmap] return something that do not
      match [default_contents] on constant keys.
