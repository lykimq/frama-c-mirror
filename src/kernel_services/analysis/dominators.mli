(** Module to perform dominators and postdominators analyses. This module was
    completely redesigned and provides many new functions.

    A dominator [d] of [s] is a statement such that all paths from the entry
    point of a function to [s] must go through [d].

    A postdominator [p] of [s] is a statement such that all paths from [s] to
    the return point of the function must go through [p].

    By definition, a statement always (post)dominates itself (except if it is
    unreachable).

    An immediate (post)dominator (or i(post)dom) [d] is the unique
    (post)dominator of [s] that strictly (post)dominates [s] but is
    (post)dominated by all other (post)dominators of [s].

    A common ancestor (or child) of a list of statements is a (post)dominator
    that (post)dominates all the statements

    @since 30.0-Zinc

val compute_dominators : kernel_function -> unit
(** Compute the Dominators analysis and register its result. *)

(** Compute the Postdominators analysis and register its result. *)

val get_dominators : stmt -> Cil_datatype.Stmt.Hptset.t
(** Return the [set] of dominators of the given statement.
    The empty set means the statement is unreachable. *)

val get_postdominators : stmt -> Cil_datatype.Stmt.Hptset.t
(** Return the [set] of postdominators of the given statement.
    The empty set means the statement is unreachable. *)

val get_strict_dominators : stmt -> Cil_datatype.Stmt.Hptset.t
(** Same as [get_dominators] but exclude the statement itself. The empty set
    means the statement is unreachable or is only dominated by itself. *)

val get_strict_postdominators : stmt -> Cil_datatype.Stmt.Hptset.t
(** Same as [get_postdominators] but exclude the statement itself. The empty set
    means the statement is unreachable or is only post-dominated by itself. *)

val nearest_common_ancestor : stmt list -> stmt option
(** Return the closest common ancestor of the given statement list.
    @before 30.0-Zinc previous implementation always returned a statement and

    dominated by a set of statements, or [Top] if unreachable. *)

    postdominated by a set of statements, or [Top] if unreachable. *)
