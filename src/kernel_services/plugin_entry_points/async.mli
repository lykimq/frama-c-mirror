    daemon to be executed on each {!yield}.
    @param debounced the least amount of time between two successive calls to
    the daemon, in milliseconds (default is 0ms).
    @param on_delayed callback is invoked as soon as the time since the last
    {!yield} is greater than [debounced] milliseconds (or 100ms at least).
    @param on_finished callback is invoked when the callback is unregistered.
