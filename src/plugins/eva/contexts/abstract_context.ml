(** An abstract context can be used to transfer information from the state of
    an abstract domain, in which an expression or lvalue is evaluated, to a
    value abstraction, which interprets operations during this evaluation.
    The context is built by the function [build_context] of abstract domains,
    and passed as argument of most transfer functions from {!Abstract_value}. *)
