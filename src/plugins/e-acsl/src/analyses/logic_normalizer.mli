(** This module is dedicated to some preprocessing on the predicates:
    - It guards all the [Pvalid] and [Pvalid_read] clauses with
      an adequate [Pinitialized] clause;
    - It replaces all the applications [Papp] by a corresponding
      term obtained as an application [Tapp]
      The predicates that have undergone these changed are
      called the preprocessed predicates.
