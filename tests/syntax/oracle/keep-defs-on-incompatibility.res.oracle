[kernel] User Error: Incompatible declaration for get_S:
  Definitions of struct S are not isomorphic. Reason follows:
  different integer types:
  'char' and 'int'
  struct S {
     char field ;
  };
  struct S {
     int field ;
  };
  
  First declaration was at keep-defs-on-incompatibility.i:10
  Current declaration is at keep-defs-on-incompatibility-companion.i:9
