%% This document is no longer consistent with the current \framac implementation
%% (\framac \framacversion). When a particular part of the document is known to be
%% out-of-date, the following mention comes in front of it.

%% \outofdate{part}

%% But even without this mention, any part of the document may be also obsolete:
%% feel free to report us such a behavior as "feature request" on
%% \url{http://bts.frama-c.com}. In any way, it is \emph{not} a bug, but an
%% assumed possible behavior.

%% Please be sure that we will do our best to improve this awkward situation in
%% future releases.

\chapter*{Foreword}
\markright{}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Foreword}

This is the documentation of the \framac
implementation\footnote{\url{http://frama-c.com}} which aims at
helping developers integrate new plug-ins inside this platform.

The content of this document corresponds to the version \framacversion,
released on \today, of \framac.
However the development of \framac is still ongoing: features
described here may still evolve in the future.
